### Things that worked

+ The devision of labour looked to be working. The proof would have really been in pulling the app together ... so TBC. 

+ I think the stack choice is mostly working out? 

### Things to do better

+ However under-ambitious the idea is for the hackathon, its still too ambitious.

+ Don't use any unfamiliar library or tool. You don't have time time to find out if and how it works. 

### Takeaways

+ I like starting with the (simplest) app. I don't know if we want to re-order our milestones. Or just squash the task of the last milestones forward
