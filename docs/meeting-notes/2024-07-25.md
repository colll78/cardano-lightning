## Back to the basics

- What is resolution? Do we need recipient signature or secret is enough?
  Seems to be enough.
- Two new diagrams with the simplest possible sequences of interactions:
  - Subbit flow: two parties
  - Subbit flow but with confirmations and possible consensus unconstraint cheque exchange

## Cashing out procedures

- The downsides of cheques regarding the unbounded loss.
- Do we need round `id`
  Detailed breakdown here: ../adrs/channel-state-representation.md
