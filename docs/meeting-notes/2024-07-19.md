## Agenda

- Hello
- Well done
- Berlin hackathon aims

### Design

- How feature-full are we aiming for

@paluh : Fragmentation degrades user experience.
Integration is hard

@waalge : There wont be a one-size-fits-all so there will be non-standard versions
however hard we try.
The larger the feature set, the harder it is for (other) integrators because
they need to handle cases not relevant to their concerns eg what if the channel
get locked in hydra.

### Actionables

- [x] Setup this repo.
