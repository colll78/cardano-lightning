# Cardano Lightning : L2 Peer Protocol Spec

This document covers the basic message structure and base protocol messages (like `init` and `ping-poing`) and peer channel protocol which is responsible for opening, closing, and maintaining a channel between two peers. In other words we loosely follow and cover the scope of the BLN [bolt#1](https://github.com/Lighting/bolts/blob/master/01-messaging.md) and [bolt#2](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md) in this document. There are three phases: establishment, normal operation, and closing.

## Connection and the Message Serialization

Each peer connection MUST use a single, shared link for all channel messages, with messages distinguished by their channel IDs.

We assume that the secure communication channel is already established between two peers and that authentication of the partners nodes is done already. The authentication and the transport layer security is out of the scope of this document.

We decided to use [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/) for the message serialization so we use protobuf format to describe the messages. Some parts of the protocol rely on CBOR encoded structures (`cheque`, `snapshot` etc.) which are not directly exchanged but are rather reconstructed by both partners so only the signatures are exchanged. These payloads will be specified through separate CDDLs.

## Messages

### Setup and Control

#### `init`

Once a connection is established, both peers MUST send an `init` message before any other messages. This is the first message revealing the features supported by the sending node.

```haskell
type Version = Integer

data Init = Init
    { version :: Version
    -- We can add feature bits/flags later if needed
    }
```

A node:
- MUST send `init` as the first Lightning message for any connection
- MUST wait to receive `init` before sending any other messages
- SHOULD reject unknown protocol versions by closing the connection

#### The `error` and `warning` Messages

For diagnosis and error handling, a node can tell its peer that something has gone wrong.

```haskell
data Error = Error
  { channelId :: Maybe ChannelId -- When channel id is missing (empty bytestring) the error is related to the whole connection
  , message :: Text
  }

data Warning = Warning
  { channelId :: ChannelId
  , message :: Text
  }
```

A sending node:
- SHOULD send `error` for protocol violations or internal errors that make channels unusable
- SHOULD send `error` with unknown channelId in reply to messages related to unknown channels
- when sending error: MUST fail the channel(s) referred to by the error message
- when sending warning: MAY continue channel operation

A receiving node:
- upon receiving error:
  - if channelId is emtpy bytestring: MUST fail all channels with the sending node
  - otherwise: MUST fail the channel referred to by channelId
- upon receiving warning:
  - MAY continue channel operation

##### Future Error Handling Design Note

In future protocol versions, error handling will be formalized in one of two possible approaches:

Global error enumeration:
- A single enumeration covering all possible protocol errors
- Each error would have a specific code and standardized meaning
- Similar to HTTP status codes but specific to CL protocol
```haskell
data ProtocolError
   = InvalidVersion
   | UnknownChannel
   | InvalidSignature
   | InvalidState
   -- etc.
```

Context-specific errors:
- Each message type/operation would have its own error enumeration
- Errors are tightly coupled to the context where they can occur
- Provides more precise error handling and type safety
``` haskell
data OpenError
    = UnsupportedParameters
    | InvalidRange
    ...
data AcceptError
    = InsufficientGift
    ...
```

### The `ping` and `pong` Messages

To allow for long-lived TCP connections and to detect unresponsive peers, nodes can send ping messages.

```haskell
data Ping = Ping
  { ignored :: ByteString -- should be zeroes
  }

data Pong = Pong
  { byteslen :: Word16 , ignored :: bytestring -- should be zeroes } ```

A node:
 - SHOULD set ignored to zeros
- MUST NOT set ignored to sensitive data
if it doesn't receive a corresponding pong:
- MAY close the network connection
- MUST NOT fail the channels in this case

A node receiving ping:
- if `numPongBytes` is less than 65532: MUST respond with a pong with bytesLen equal to numPongBytes
- otherwise: MUST ignore the ping

## Core Types

These are core types used in different places of the protocol:

```haskell
type Index = Integer

-- Should we introduce "feature flags" similar to BLN:
data Version = Version1

-- 28 bytes of blake2b hash
data CurrencySymbol = ByteString

-- 32 bytes of some hash plus extra payload
data ChannelId = ByteString

type Amount = Integer

type TestnetMagic = Integer

data NetworkId = Mainnet | Testnet TestnetMagic

type Milliseconds = Integer

type POSIX = Integer

type TxOutRef = (ByteString, Integer)

-- 32 bytes of sha256 hash
type Sha256Hash = ByteString

type Ed25519PubKey = ByteString

-- 64 bytes of Ed25519 signature
type Signature = ByteString

data Snapshot = Snapshot
  { amount0 :: Amount
  , amount1 :: Amount
  , idx0 :: Index
  , idx1 :: Index
  , exc0 :: [Integer]
  , exc1 :: [Integer]
  }
```

## Channel Establishment

Channel establishment consists of several steps:
1. Initial negotiation of channel parameters:  `Open` -> `Accept` || `Error`.
2. On-chain channel notification and verification `ChannelStaged`.
3. Or early canc

### Messages

```haskell
-- Helper type for parameter negotiation
data Range a
  = Range
    { minValue :: a
    , maxValue :: a
    }

data ChannelEstablishment
  | AcceptedRanges
    { networkId :: NetworkId
    , currencySymbol :: CurrencySymbol
    , fundingAmount :: Range Amount
    , requiredGift :: Amount
    , respondPeriod :: Range Milliseconds
    , minimumDepth :: Range Integer
    , giftAmount :: Amount
    , maxHtlcValue :: Range Amount
    , maxTotalHtlcValue :: Range Amount
    , maxHtlcCount :: Range Integer
    }
  | Open
    { networkId :: NetworkId
    , channelId :: ChannelId
    , currencySymbol :: CurrencySymbol
    , fundingAmount :: Range Amount  -- Min/max range for negotiation
    , giftAmount :: Amount          -- Initial amount gifted to counterparty
    , respondPeriod :: Range Milliseconds
    , minimumDepth :: Range Integer
    , minHtlcValue :: Range Amount
    , maxHtlcValue :: Range Amount
    , maxTotalHtlcValue :: Range Amount
    , maxHtlcCount :: Range Integer
    , pubKey :: Ed25519PubKey
    }
  | Accept
    { channelId :: ChannelId
    , fundingAmount :: Amount       -- Chosen from proposed range
    , respondPeriod :: Milliseconds
    , minimumDepth :: Integer
    , minHtlcValue :: Amount
    , maxHtlcValue :: Amount
    , maxTotalHtlcValue :: Amount
    , maxHtlcCount :: Integer
    , pubKey :: Ed25519PubKey
    }
  | ChannelStaged
    { channelId :: ChannelId
    , txOutRef :: TxOutRef        -- Reference to the on-chain channel UTXO
    }
```

### Channel Opening Process

The channel opener sends an Open message containing:
- Proposed ranges for all negotiable parameters
- Their public key for channel operation
- Initial funding and gift amounts
- Network and currency identification

The counterparty can:
- Respond with `Accept` choosing specific values from each proposed range
- Respond with `Error` if any parameters are unacceptable

After successful negotiation, the opener:
- Submits the transaction creating the channel utxo
- Sends `ChannelStaged` with the UTXO reference
  or:
  Sends an `Error` with `channelId` and reason

The counterparty:
- Verifies the on-chain utxo matches negotiated parameters
- Confirms with `ChannelStaged` and starts channel operation
  or:
  Responds with Error if verification fails

Requirements
A node sending Open:
- MUST set all ranges to contain acceptable values
- MUST ensure minimum values are less than or equal to maximum values
- MUST set networkId to match the intended blockchain network
- SHOULD set reasonable ranges to increase chance of acceptance

A node receiving Open:

MUST respond with either Accept or Error
if responding with Accept:
MUST choose values within each proposed range
MUST verify it can operate with chosen parameters
MUST NOT accept if any parameters are unacceptable
SHOULD respond with Error if ranges are unreasonable
A node sending Accept:

MUST set all parameters to values within proposed ranges
MUST be prepared to operate channel with chosen parameters
A node receiving Accept:

MUST verify all chosen values are within proposed ranges
MUST NOT create channel if any parameters are outside ranges
SHOULD proceed with channel creation if all parameters are acceptable
A node sending ChannelStaged:

MUST have created the on-chain UTXO
MUST ensure UTXO matches all negotiated parameters
A node receiving ChannelStaged:

MUST verify the referenced UTXO exists on-chain
MUST verify UTXO parameters match negotiated values
MUST NOT begin channel operation until verification succeeds

##### Future Terms Discovery Design Note

```haskell
data TermsDiscovery
  = QueryTerms
    { currency :: Currency
    }
  | Terms
    { currency :: Currency
    , minPeerFunding :: Amount       -- Minimum funding required from peer
    , minGiftAmount :: Amount        -- Minimum "service fee" required
    , operatingRanges :: OperatingRanges
    , serviceFeatures :: ServiceFeatures  -- e.g. uptime guarantees, routing policies
    }
```


### `ChannelAdd`
￼
```haskell
type Index = Integer

-- Should we introduce "feature flags" similar to BLN:
data Version = Version1

-- (28 bytes of blake2b hash, 32 bytes of token name)
type Currency = (ByteString, ByteString)

-- 32 bytes of some hash plus extra payload
data ChannelId = ByteString

type Amount = Integer

type TestnetMagic = Integer

data NetworkId = Mainnet | Testnet TestnetMagic

type Milliseconds = Integer

type POSIX = Integer

type TxOutRef = (ByteString, Integer)

-- 32 bytes of sha256 hash
type Sha256Hash = ByteString

type Ed25519PubKey = ByteString

-- 64 bytes of Ed25519 signature
type Signature = ByteString

data Snapshot = Snapshot
    { amount0 :: Amount
    , amount1 :: Amount
    , idx0 :: Index
    , idx1 :: Index
    , exc0 :: [Integer]
    , exc1 :: [Integer]
    }

-- TODO:
-- Should we notify separately about tx settlement attempt and about
-- the step finalization like `FundsAdd` and `FundsAdded/FundsAddConfirmed`?
-- In BLN splicing proposal there is no separate message but it is probablyand
-- assumed from the context (the transcation creation precedes the tx settlement).
-- * If we won't notify the partner about tx settlement attempt then we can have collisions
-- but maybe that is not a problem - we have to monitor the chain anyway and discover changes.
-- * If we notify separately about the attempt and provide the details then we have to introduce
-- probably some kind of abort action if it was colliding etc.

-- Tx verification through Mithril:
-- * We have to be prepared that in order to use Mithril efficiently (using its current API) we will
-- use `/proof/cardano-transaction`'
-- * In order to use that endpoint we have to actually construct transaction client side
-- * In order to construct transaction on the client side we should:
--      * Receive or reconstruct the transaction CBOR
--      * Check the UTxO of that transaction
-- * Mithril will have probably in the future queries like "utxo-by-addresses" - it seems that they are not 
-- part of the aggregator HTTP API yet. It seem rather useless in our case anyway.
type Tx = ByteString

-- During any negociation we use ranges to speed up the process
